GOAL
The Space station was knocked out of it's controlled orbit by a 

meteor, still circling and dangerous. It will spiral out toward 

space if it can't fire up its manouvering jets. But thet're not 

working.  You need to do a Space walk find damage.

 You are the RED Helmet. Camera sees the back of your head. 

Start by hitting UP Arrow, move forward. The crawler will 

diappear if you fly thru it. Then turn 180 degrees with the left or 

right arrow. You'll see the station you just came out of.  

If you get a fuel low indicator.

You can see  GREEN emergency fuel tanks in geostationary Earth 

orbit to pick up fuel. They disappear when you hit them. 4 in all, 

wait  for next if you missed.

Find RED cap on end of station. Exterior Emergency panel that 

needs to be turned off to restart the jets. You hear applause  

that you saved the day when you touch it.

Take the rest of the day off, fly around and enjoy the scenery 

and feel of weightlessness. There's a moon in the far corner. Visit 

and fly back.

Sorry. There's no way to reenter the station. It was a one way 

mission. But the rest of the crew will be safe. Hit ESC to end.

I'm aiming to make this VR next version.
